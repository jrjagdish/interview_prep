        question: "How is this different from a regular AI chatbot?",
        answer: "Unlike standard chatbots, we use Groq LPU™ technology and LiveKit to provide sub-second latency. This means the AI reacts to your speech in real-time, just like a human interviewer, allowing for natural interruptions and follow-up questions."
    },
    {
        question: "Does the AI understand technical jargon and code?",
        answer: "Yes. By leveraging Deepgram's advanced speech-to-text, our AI accurately transcribes complex technical terms, variable names, and architectural concepts. It then uses high-performance models to evaluate your React, Python, or FastAPI logic line-by-line."
    },
    {
        question: "How realistic is the interviewer's voice and video?",
        answer: "Extremely. We use Cartesia's lifelike voice synthesis to provide emotional nuance and professional tone. Combined with LiveKit's high-fidelity streaming, the environment mimics a real Zoom or Google Meet technical screening."
    },
    {
        question: "What exactly is analyzed in my feedback report?",
        answer: "You receive a 'Readiness Score' across four categories: Technical Logic, Code Efficiency, Communication Style (using the STAR method), and Behavioral Delivery. We also provide an optimized version of the code you wrote during the session."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I practice for specific company patterns like Google or Amazon?",
        answer: "Yes. You can configure the AI to prioritize specific interview styles, whether it's LeetCode-style data structures, system design deep-dives, or leadership principle behavioral rounds."
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a trial available for new users?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Our 'Free Tier' allows you to experience three full-length AI mock sessions with basic analysis so you can feel the speed of our Groq-powered engine before upgrading."
